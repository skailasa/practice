# Sorting Algorithms

Of those asked in interviews, merge sort, quick sort, and bucket sort are the most common.

## Bubble Sort
- Start at beginning of array and swap two elements if the first greater than the second
- Do so for next pair, continuously sweeping the array until it's sorted.
- Smaller items slowly 'bubble' to beginning of array.
- Runtime O(N^2), average and worst case. Memory O(1) - Only have to keep two values in memory.

## Selection Sort
- Simple and inefficient
- Find the smallest element using a linear scan, and swap with first element
- Find the second smallest, and repeat etc.
- Runtime O(N^2) average and worst case. Memory O(1)
