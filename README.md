There's a great, potentially apocryphal story of Richard Feynman learning
to draw at the age of 44. He met an artist at a party, and got into a debate
about the nature of human expression. He argued that science was greater than
art because it required the composition of a scientist's ingenuity as well as
a deep understanding of nature. The artist fought back, reasoning that art was
superior as it did not rely on nature's own inherent beauty to produce something
unique. In anycase they ended up agreeing to tutor each other, Feynman would
study art and he would teach his new friend Physics. He was 44 when he started,
and his initial sketches were rumoured to be terrible. However, stuck with it
for the rest of his life, he was never amazing, but he ended up producing quite
lovely pieces.

The point isn't so much that practice made him perfect, but it certainly made
him better.
