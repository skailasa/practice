Machine Learning notes and practice.

## Unsupervised methods

### Principle Component Analysis
- 'Rotates' dataset so that the rotated features are statistically uncorellated. Followed by a selection of a subset of features.
- I.e. finding the axes of main directions of variance in the dataset.
- Can be used for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional data (e.g. images) by retaining only some of the principle components.
