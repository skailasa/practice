Learning about software design through idiomatic patterns.

## Classifications
- Creational: They describe how an object is created, ie. `Singleton` in which only one instance of a class can be created. e.g. we need a single instance of a logger logging to a file.
- Structural: They describe how objects and classes work together to achieve a larger result, ie. `Facade` pattern, where the class acts as a facade in from of complex classes and objects to present the client a simple interface.
- Behavioural: They talk about interaction between objects, `Mediatior` design patterns - where an object of a mediator class, mediates the interaction of objects of different classes to get the desired process working.
