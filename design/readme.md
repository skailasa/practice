# Object-Oriented Design

Notes built on top of Cracking the Code

## How to Approach
Remember, don't try and waste time finding the 'right' pattern, there are always loads of ways to consider and model software. Need to just figure out how to model with something that is maintainable and also works!

### 1) Handle Ambiguity
- Need to spend time clarifying assumptions and asking client for more information.
- Ask all about who/how this is going to be used, this will massively reflect the way in which you design something.

### 2) Define the Core Objects
- E.G. designing a Cafe, core objects might be Barista, Table, Order etc.

### 3) Analyse Relationships
- Which objects are members of other objects? How are they related? One to Many? Many-to-One?
- Incorrect assumptions will lead to incorrect relationship modelling.

### 4) Investigate Actions
- Consider how objects will interact with each other in different scenarios.

A couple of the most common patterns are Singleton and Factory Method, make sure to internalise these.
