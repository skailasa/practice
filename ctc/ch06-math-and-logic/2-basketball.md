# Basketball
You have a basketball hoop and can play one of two games
1) You get one shot to make the hoop
2) You get three shots and you have to make 2/3 shots
if p is the probability of making a shot, for what values of p would you pick one game over the other?

I would always pick the first game, p^2(1-p)<p for all p in [0, 1)
