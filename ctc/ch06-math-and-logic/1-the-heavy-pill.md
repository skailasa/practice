# The Heavy Pill

- Easy one to get started...
- Just note that number of pills == weight in grams for 19/20 bottles
- weight in grams 10% more than number of pills for only 1 bottle
- just put different numbers from each bottle, and then measure the weight
- use formula weight-(number_of_pills) = remainder
- remainder*10 = number of pills from bottle with heavier pills
