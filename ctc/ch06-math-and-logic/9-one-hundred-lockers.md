# 100 Lockers

100 closed lockers in a hallway, a toggles (opens/closes) the ith locker
on each pass from 1 to 100, after 100 passes how many lockers open?

Easy, notice that (except for 1) all prime numbers are closed. Then can
work out whether a given locker number is closed by how many factors it
has (even = closed, odd = open).
