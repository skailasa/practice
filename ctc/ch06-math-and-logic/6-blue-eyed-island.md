# Blue Eyed Island

Island of random eye-color distribution. All blue-eyes must leave, but
only one flight per day. Can see others eyes, but not own eyes, cannot
communicate. See everyone else every day. At least 1 with blue eyes.
How long till all blue eyed folks leave?

By induction, if you see everyone everyday, and no-one has blue eyes then
you are blue eyed, you will leave on first day.
