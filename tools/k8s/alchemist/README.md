# alchemist

Welcome to Alchemist! The number one Python Library for alchemical
simulations.

## Installation

Install for usage as Python library, or command line app.

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Install for usage in editable mode.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install development and testing requirements.

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Usage

One can use alchemist either as a Python library, from the command
line, or as a containerised app hosted somewhere.

### As a Python Library

```python
>>> from alchemist.laboratory import load_substance_data
>>> from alchemist.laboratory import Laboratory
>>>
>>> data = load_substance_data('test_data.yml') 
>>> print(data)
{'lower': ['a'], 'upper': ['antia']}
>>>
>>> lab = Laboratory(data)
>>>
>>> # run a full experiment until all possible reactions complete
>>> lab.run_experiment()
{'lower': [], 'upper': []}
>>>
>>> # count the number of reactions
>>> lab.reaction_count
2
```

### From the Command Line

One can also use the package as a command line tool.

```bash
abracadabra data.yml --reactions
```

This returns the final composition of your shelves only to stdout.
The optional `--reactions` returns the number of reactions only to
stdout. 

###Â As a Dockerised App

You can build this application using the provided Docker file, and
deploy to K8s or another containerisation orchestrator.

To build locally, make sure you're in the top level directory of the
project, containing the Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build -t alchemist:latest .

# Host locally on port 5000
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 alchemist

# Use provided client app
python client.py <file.yml>
```

NOTE: `data.yml` **MUST** contain a dict of lists, where the keys are
the shelf names, and the values in a respective list are the substances
in that shelf.

e.g. The shelves,

```python
{'lower': ['a', 'antib'], 'upper': ['b', 'antia']}

```

should be stored in YAML as a dict of lists, either:

```yaml
lower
- a
- antib
upper
- b
- antia
```

or

```yaml
{
  lower: [
    a, 
    antib
  ], 
  upper: [
    b, 
    antia
  ]
}
```

At present only two shelf standard laboratories are supported.


### Testing

Make sure to have install the `dev` requirements.

```python
# run tests
pytest alchemist/tests/

# run coverage
pytest --cov=alchemist/tests/
```
